    The solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is a critical component in batteries, acting as a charge transport bridge between the electrode and electrolyte, significantly influencing battery performance. While cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) has been widely used to evaluate SEI, many studies assume or even claim its mighty ability to protect against electron beam irradiation damage.
    <br><br>
    This study disproves that assumption by demonstrating the formation of Li₂O under accumulated electron doses by comparing short and prolonged electron exposure of SEI. High-resolution TEM (HRTEM), used quite often in cryo-conditions in previous studies and also in this study, requires a high dose rate (~1000 e⁻/Å²·s), which can immediately induce artifacts. In contrast, scanning electron nanobeam diffraction with a small probe dose (178 e⁻/Å²) and small convergence semi-angle reveals the SEI as amorphous, contradicting HRTEM observation. Selected area electron diffraction and electron energy loss spectroscopy further indicate that total electron doses of 450 e⁻/Å² and 600 e⁻/Å² are sufficient to induce Li₂O formation in SEI layers of Li metal deposited in LiFSI+LiTFSI/DME and LiPF₆/EC-DEC electrolytes, respectively.
    <br><br>
    Nanostructure characterization in batteries can be challenging due to electron beam interactions that can lead to erroneous conclusions. The paper suggests the use of scanning TEM, and even more, 4D-STEM for comprehensive yet artifact-free characterization in the cryogenic environment but note that this can certainly be data-intensive and expensive to be considered for routine work.
