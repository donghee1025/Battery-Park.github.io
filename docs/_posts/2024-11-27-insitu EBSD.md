    The battery industry is gradually transitioning to all-solid-state batteries (ASSBs), creating a growing demand for advanced techniques to visualize dissolution and deposition processes within these systems. In this context, the authorsâ€™ work is particularly promising, as it employs in-situ electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) analysis to investigate the evolution of the cross-sectional microstructure of Li and Na metals interfaced with widely studied solid electrolytes. The study effectively demonstrates the grain size and orientation evolution during charge(plating) and highlights pore formation during discharge (stripping).

    Characterizing lithium (or sodium) microstructures using EBSD, especially in-situ, is an exceptionally challenging task due to several technical hurdles. Firstly, the sample must be meticulously polished and flat to ensure accurate analysis. Secondly, focused ion beam (FIB) cutting must be performed under cryogenic conditions to prevent artifacts. Thirdly, electron beam intensity and EBSD sensitivity must be precisely optimized to generate meaningful results. Additionally, the sample must be stored and transported under inert gas or vacuum conditions at all times, further complicating the process.
    <br><br>
    Despite these challenges, this work is an important stepping stone for understanding key phenomena in ASSBs. Future studies could build upon these findings by diversifying testing conditions and conducting comprehensive quantitative analyses to gain deeper insights into the underlying mechanisms driving battery performance.
