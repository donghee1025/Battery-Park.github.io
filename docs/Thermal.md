  <h2>&#9672; Thermal transfer </h2>
  <ul>Thermal conductivity is important as it affects the cell’s temperature distribution and influences cooling. The anisotropic thermal conduction of the battery can be characterized by in-plane (axial) thermal conductivity parallel to the cell layers and cross-plane (radial) thermal conductivity perpendicular to the layers. In-plane conductivity is roughly one order of magnitude higher than cross-plane conductivity. With the increase in SOC and the operating temperature, thermal conductivity goes up.</ul>
  <hr>
  <ul>According to the Fourier’s Law of heat conduction with steady-state heat flow (∂T/∂t=0), it reads:
    <br>
    $$ {q = - \kappa\nabla{T}} $$ ,where q is heat flux vector and &#x3BA; is thermal conductivity, and T is temperature.
    <br><br>
    For the 1-d heat conduction, it is simply q = &#x3BA; dx/dT or more generally it can be written as:
    <br>
     $$ {Q = - \kappa{A}\frac{dT}{dx}} $$ ,where Q is heat and A is the cross-sectional area, and d is the legth of the heat conduction in the cartesian coordinate.
  </ul>
