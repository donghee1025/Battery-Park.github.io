  <h2>&#9672; Thermal transfer </h2>
  <ul>Thermal conductivity is important as it affects the cell’s temperature distribution and influences cooling. The anisotropic thermal conduction of the battery can be characterized by in-plane (axial) thermal conductivity parallel to the cell layers and cross-plane (radial) thermal conductivity perpendicular to the layers. In-plane conductivity is roughly one order of magnitude higher than cross-plane conductivity. With the increase in SOC and the operating temperature, thermal conductivity goes up.</ul>

  According to the Fourier’s Law of heat conduction with steady-state heat flow (∂T/∂t=0), it reads:

  $$ {q = - \kappa\nabla{T}} $$
